# Project Description
<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. --> 

One way to treat liver tumor is thermal ablation, delivered using a needle-like device. This ablation needle is inserted through the skin (percutaneously) under ultrasound visualization. In a typical surgical scenario, this procedure is performed free-hand: surgeon holds the US probe in one-hand and the ablation needle at the other, and the ablation needle is inserted slowly under ultrasound guidance/visualization.

Because the US is 2D in nature and visualized on the US machine, surgeon must mentally reconstruct the 3D spatial relationship between the US probe and the needle. Moreoever, ablation needle is NOT readily visible untile it "intersects" with the US image.

Hence we are developing a surgical guidance system for this needle procedure. Assuming the availability of both a tracked/calibrated US transducer and a tracked/calibrated needle guide, we wish to display their spatial relationship in 3D and in real-time.


## Objective
1. A Slicelet GUI for 3D visualization. 
2. Interface with PLUS library for the transmission of US image and tracking data.
